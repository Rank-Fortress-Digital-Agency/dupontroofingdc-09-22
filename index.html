We encourage all of our clients to feel welcome to establish a long-term relationship with our company. We are happy to offer our professional advice on systems upkeep and planning to our repeat customers and long-term clients.

                            Our company provides a wider range of roofing related services than other companies. Often, other roof companies in Washington DC, even our competitors, hire our company to make repairs to building system types outside of the specific roofing discipline. Our company has been hired and completed multiple projects to repair brick parapets where brick masonry was found to be deteriorated under the existing coping metals. When the coping was replaced,the brick was discovered to be in extreme disrepair. Other roofing companies and building owners have called upon us to make the repairs that other roofing companies could not do themselves. Our company is crossed trained in principle systems which interface with the roof system so that we can offer a more comprehensive service.

                            In addition to our regular upkeep and maintenance services we also offer the following types of flat roof conditions surveys.

                <p>
                    We offer this service to clients as a proactive and pragmatic approach to managing the condition of a building. The roof is simply one of the most important building systems and parts of a building. Roof leaks, whether spawned from deterioration, delamination, damage from falling objects from above, or from mother nature, can lead to leaks which can cause exponential damage to the parts of the building below. We recommend our clients engage a company like ours to keep a close eye on the condition and health of a roof system. A roof doesn't exist alone or independent from other building systems. In almost all cases a roof system also interfaces with several other types of building services such as mechanical and HVAC, electrical systems, chimney and flue or exhaust systems, solar panels or photovoltaic PV systems, and telecommunication systems mounted on rooftops. All of these other systems, although unrelated to the roof itself, are interconnected through mechanical attachment, penetration through, or adjacent termination to the roof membrane.

                <p>
                    Forensic condition surveys can be used to identify the cause of damage or leakage. In many cases, the actual source of damage may be due to improper construction, or damage from the elements. Experience in multiple disciplines, we can trace back through and open up building assemblies to identify the identifiable causes and report on damages.

                    Due diligence condition surveys may be very useful in understanding the condition of your building's roof before and in preparation for negotiations related to a property's value. It's often very useful for a building owner to understand a life-cycle cost analysis and projection for repairs and seasonal upkeep of their roof.

                    Installation Conditions Surveys

                <p>
                    Installation conditions surveys can be completed by certified roofing contractors such as ourselves to verify that other roofing contractors have installed roof systems properly. Far too often, here in Washington DC, DCRA provides very little oversight. And, it's far too common that roofing contractors are untrained. Our company has an extensive training program and as a certified contractor we take quality control to be the most important of all matters.. However, we can perform a survey of conditions of work, work completed by other contractors as an oversight. It can be very helpful to know whether or not a roof was installed properly.
